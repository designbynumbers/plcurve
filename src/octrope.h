  The main "combined" call allows the user to obtain all of the information
  determined by the octrope library in a single call. 

  This call computes both the ropelength and the strut list, as well as
  finding the locations at which minrad is in control of ropelength. 

  A brief explanation of the variables follows:

     <strutlist>    will contain a list of all struts with length less than
                    <strut_cutoff> or, if strut_cutoff=0, within <epsilon> of
                    the shortest strut. The size of the list is passed in
                    <sl_size>, and the number of entries returned in
                    <num_struts>.

     <lambda>       is the stiffness of the rope. One can view lambda as an a
                    priori lower bound on the diameter of curvature of the unit
                    thickness rope. 

     <min_rad_locs> will contain a list of all the vertices at which min_rad is
                    at the controlling value. As with the strut list, <mr_size>
                    gives the size of the list, and the number of such entries
                    found is passed back in <num_min_rad_locs>. 

     <mem> and 
     <memsize>      can be used to pass octrope a memory buffer to use for the
                    computation.  The memory does not have to be zeroed ahead
                    of time. If <memsize> is 0, or <mem> is NULL, octrope will
                    allocate its own memory. 

  Octrope returns -1 on failure, or 1 for success.
