This is the plCurve library, designed for working with piecewise linear 
(not necessarily connected) R^3 curves.  It also includes vector-handling 
routines and some basic support for spline equivalents of the plCurves.

New in library versions 7.0.1 (and later), this includes the functionality
of the previous octrope library for computing the thickness and ropelength
of polygonal curves.
