This is the plCurve library, designed for working with piecewise linear 
(not necessarily connected) R^3 curves.  It also includes vector-handling 
routines and some basic support for spline equivalents of the plCurves.

New in library versions 7.0.1 (and later), this includes the functionality
of the previous octrope library for computing the thickness and ropelength
of polygonal curves.

Python Module `libpl`
=====================

plCurve comes with a Python module for accessing and manipulating
plCurve objects from Python scripts. Presently, the most robust part
of this module is the `pdcode` submodule that makes available most of
the functionality of `pdcode`s and other features in `plctopology.h`.

Running configure will try to find the necessary libraries to build
the Python module. To disable these checks and the Python building,
pass `--disable-python` to the configure script. Required is Python
2.7 (and associated development headers) and Numpy. Optional but
recommended is Cython 0.23+ (Cython is required for development
builds). If Cython is installed but you would prefer not to use it,
pass `--disable-cython` to the configure script.

The Python module by default, will try to install the Python module
to your system's Python module directory (Python itself determines
this). This usually requires superuser privileges. Passing
`--enable-python-otherdir=user` will instead install the module to the
directory which Python has determined to be a user's personal Python
module directory. Either of these choices are typically already on
Python's PYTHONPATH, and should not require additional
configuration. In some circumstances, it may be preferable to install
the Python module specifically to the prefix determined by the
configure script; `--enable-python-otherdir=prefix` enables this
functionality, but be aware that Python may not search this location
for modules by default (Macs in particular get confused by this).

Python documentation gets built automatically from docstrings
available in the module. This requires Sphinx, a Python documentation
package. After installing the `libpl` module, the make command `make
html` will build the documentation and place it in
`BUILD_DIR/pysrc/built_doc`.

Some features of the Python module require the external packages
Spherogram and PLink (available at http://www.math.uic.edu/t3m/), but
these packages are not required in general. It is listed in the
docstrings (and documentation) of functions which require these
modules.
