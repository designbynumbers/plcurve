1) Create constraint-aware resample call for increasing or decreasing (or just
   equilateralizing) the number of vertices a plCurve has.

2) Add a per-vertex quantifier to the file format.  Should be expressed as
   TAG: 0.123456  (three-character, case-insensitive tag, colon, space,
   double).  These will be stored along with the cst: quantifiers in the 
   # comments following each vertex.  They should be read in, stored and
   written out automatically.  There should be a way to extract them from 
   memory into a structure paralleling the plCurve (but with only one 
   double per vertex) and a way to put them back into memory.  Once extracted 
   they should be considered separate from the plCurve and unless put back into
   it will not automatically be written.

3) Allocate vertex blocks in one large chunk instead of multiple mallocs.

4) Do something nicer, if there is something nicer to be done, regarding 
   inlining in the library itself.

5) The curvature, torsion, and tangent vector stuff should be brought
   up to modern theory standards, using (e.g., the three, four, and
   five-point estimators of Langer et. al. -- see the DRL for the
   paper).

6) Find flype circuits automatically and write a utility program which
   gives all of the flype-equivalent diagrams for a given diagram. (Claus)

7) Better interface with KnotTheory and Mathematica.
