1) Create constraint-aware resample call for increasing or decreasing the
   number of vertices a plCurve has.

2) Add a per-vertex quantifier to the file format.  Should be expressed as
   TAG: 0.123456  (three-character, case-insensitive tag, colon, space,
   double).  These will be stored along with the cst: quantifiers in the 
   # comments following each vertex.  They should be read in, stored and
   written out automatically.  There should be a way to extract them from 
   memory into a structure paralleling the plCurve (but with only one 
   double per vertex) and a way to put them back into memory.  Once extracted 
   they should be considered separate from the plCurve and unless put back into
   it will not automatically be written.

3) Variable args in plCurve_set_constraint.
