Dear Editors and Referees,

Thank you for the helpful and informative referee reports. We have edited the paper accordingly, and are now resubmitting. 

1) We have added references to "Entanglement Complexity of Graphs in Z^3" by Soteros et al., and to "The knotting of equilateral polygons in R^3" by Diao and "Global knotting in equilateral random polygons" by Diao et al. at the end of paragraph 1. (Thank you for the reminder!)

2) Added a reference to "Ranking Knots of Random, Globular Polymer Rings" by Baiesi, Orlandini and Stella on page 2, and changed the discussion of Zipf laws on page 18 slightly after reading the paper. We hadn't read this paper before, so this was a very valuabe suggestion-- thank you again!

3) We cut the detailed description of the computation, noting that more information was available in the arxiv version of the paper for anyone interested. 

4) Actually, Chapman has managed to prove that symmetries become exponentially rare. His paper will be uploaded to arxiv shortly.

5) This was a bug in the script that generated the table. We've patched in the 5_1 data (and, as expected, 5_1 is less common than 5_2).

6) As mentioned above, we've edited accordingly. 

We appreciate the comments of the second referee regarding the style of the manuscript as well. As we are mathematicians, our writing style may be different from the more concise style of the physics literature. We've tried to tighten the exposition here as best we can, and will keep this in mind for future papers in physics journals.

Again, we appreciate the helpful efforts of both referees and the editors regarding our paper. 

Jason Cantarella, Harrison Chapman, and Matt Mastin
