Let P be a particular map that can appear as a submap of maps in our class. There is often a strong 0–1 law for the property that P is a submap of a randomly chosen map in Mn: If P is planar, then almost all Mn contain at least cn disjoint copies of P for small enough c; while if P is not planar, almost no Mn contain a copy of P. We show how to establish this for various classes of maps. For planar P, the existence of limn → ∞ |Mn|1n suffices. For nonplanar P, we require more detailed asymptotic information. "

Abstract      = {We study random knots and links in R^3 using the Petaluma model, which is
based on the petal projections developed by Adams et al. (2012). In this model
we obtain a formula for the distribution of the linking number of a random
two-component link. We also obtain formulas for the expectations and the higher
moments of the Casson invariant and the order-3 knot invariant v3. These are
the first precise formulas given for the distributions of invariants in any
model for random knots or links. We also use numerical computation to compare
these to other random knot and link models, such as those based on grid
diagrams.},
