# Run "planarity -test" using planarity from the build tree and the
# samples from the source tree. This is complicated by the fact that
# the source tree may be read-only (as it is during "make distcheck"),
# meaning that we have to "relocate" the samples into a writable
# directory within the build tree rather than try to put the
# just-built planarity executable into the source tree while the test
# suite runs.
